# SoundTok, a place to share your sound
[https://soundtok.live](https://soundtok.live/#/)

Anyone, from the casual listener and discoverer of new music to the veteran producer, will find a community on SoundTok. Put together a new track by uploading audio files from your computer or loading from saved drafts and layering different sounds and effects. Once you're satisfied, post the song with a description, image, and hashtags so others can discover your music through the feed or search bar. Keep your profile up to date, so others know who you are as an artist.
